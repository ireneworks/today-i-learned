# to coddle

### to coddle vs not to coddle

Coddling is same meaning of supervision which means someone (i.e. supervisor, boss etc.,) is watching you doing well, everything is done correctly or directing. Does the workplace need coddling? Coddling could be needed in specific situation such as when someone is on onboarding process. Or someone is new like rookie, intern or trainee. But most of the situation in workplace, employees should not be coddled but self-motivated. (Also company should give their employees visions and guide the way) Company is not a school or academy who is teaching you but to work.&#x20;

In general, new comers and immigrants should be coddled but Canada doesn't have any system for them. No support for immigrants and they have to survive individually.&#x20;

Current Canada is facing crisis in many reason, and now they realised they should get through it or they'll collapse. Back in the 20s, Canada reached its peak and remained smug until Covid-19 hit.&#x20;
